I want to build a full-stack appointment booking system for a doctor using Next.js (App Router) with the following stack and features:

üß± Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)

Styling: TailwindCSS

Backend: API Routes or Route Handlers (inside Next.js)

Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

Authentication: JWT-based login (next-auth optional but not necessary)

Payment Gateway: Razorpay for payments and refunds

Email Service: NodeMailer or SendGrid

üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Project Use Case
A doctor wants a website where:

They can write about themselves (name, specialization, photo)

Users can register, log in, book appointments, and pay

The doctor can set their availability slots (date + time)

Users can choose available slots

Appointments can only be rescheduled or canceled by the doctor/admin

üîê Authentication
JWT-based login for:

Users (patients)

Doctors (admin)

Middleware for protecting API routes by role (doctor or user)

üìÖ Appointments
Users:

Can book appointments from available doctor slots

Cannot change date/time after booking

Can request rescheduling (doctor handles it)

Can view all past/future appointments

Can cancel appointment (refund via Razorpay)

Doctor:

Can log in and access an admin dashboard

Can add/remove available slots (date + multiple time slots)

Can view all booked appointments

Can mark appointments as completed or reschedule them

üí≥ Payments with Razorpay
Users must pay via Razorpay before confirming a slot

Refund logic for cancellations

Payment status is stored with appointment

Webhook for payment confirmation (optional)

üìß Email Notifications
On booking: confirmation email to both doctor and user

On cancellation or reschedule: email update
